# REDWAREHOUSE
##### A Motor Part Shop Software
- ## Description
The small automobile spare parts shop sells the spare parts for a vehicles of several makes and models. Also, each spare part is typically manufactured by several small industries. To stream line the sales and supply ordering, the shop owner has asked us to develop the following motor part shop software. So I name the software project as RedWarehouse. <br />
REDWAREHOUSE deals with large number of motor parts of various manufacturers and various vehicle types. Some of the motor parts are very small and some are of reasonably large size. The shop ownermaintains different parts in wall mounted and numbered racks. The shop owner maintains as few inventory for each item as reasonable, to reduce inventory overheads after being inspired by the just-in-time (JIT) philosophy.
